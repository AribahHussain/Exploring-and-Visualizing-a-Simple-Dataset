# 🌸 Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

This project focuses on performing basic **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the popular **Iris dataset**, a beginner-friendly dataset widely used in data science and machine learning.

## 📌 Objective

To understand the structure, patterns, and relationships in the Iris dataset using summary statistics and visualizations.

## 📂 Dataset Used

- **Name:** Iris Dataset  
- **Source:** Comes preloaded in many libraries or can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)  
- **Description:** Contains 150 samples with 4 features — *Sepal Length*, *Sepal Width*, *Petal Length*, and *Petal Width*, along with species labels.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## 📊 Key Steps

- Load and inspect the dataset (shape, columns, info, and summary stats).
- Create visualizations:
  - **Scatter Plot** (Sepal features by species)
  - **Histograms** (distribution of all numeric features)
  - **Box Plot** (spread and outliers)
  - **Pairplot** (comparison across all feature pairs)

## 📈 Insights

- Petal features are more helpful than sepal features for identifying species.
- Setosa is clearly separated, while Versicolor and Virginica show some overlap.
- No missing values, and data is well-structured for modeling.

## ✅ Conclusion

We explored the Iris dataset using basic plots and statistics.  
Clear patterns were seen, especially in petal sizes.  
Setosa was easy to spot, while the others were a bit similar.  
This is a great first step before applying machine learning models.

## 📎 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or open the notebook.
2. Ensure required libraries are installed:
